<h3 id="_Intro">Introduction</h3>
<p>The spline editor allows for the creation of custom curves made up of hermite curves. The splines can be saved out to a
xml file and loaded back in easily. In order to use the splines in other projects, the spline library will be required. The
controls and function of each tool can be found below</p>
</div>
<div class="Editor">
<h3 id="_Editor">Editor</h3>
<p>The spline editor is the big grey box to the left of the application. By default, a straight line will be constructed. 
The red knots inside the editor represent the knots of the spline. To add a new knot to the spline, left click anywhere on the
segment you wish to add the knot to (clicking will not always result in a knot being created, see <a href="#_Comments">comments</a> section for reasons).
When adding a new knot to the spline, the control points/tangents of the segments existing knots will be manipulated to keep the
original curve intact, However, if the editing mode is set to <b>Hermite</b>, the tangents will be manipulated in order to keep
consistency. To remove a knot, right click on the knot you wish to remove (keep in mind, it is impossible to remove the start and end knot!).
Removing a knot will result in the editor trying to maintain the original curve of the two segments, this may result in some whacky curves afterwards however.</p>
<p>When <b>Bezier</b> mode is active, all of the splines controls points will be represented by a blue square. The blue lines casting from the 
squares are the control points/knots said control point links from and to. To move a control point, simply click then drag the control point
to where you want it. Note that moving a knot/control point in <b>Bezier</b> mode will result in only the selected point being manipulated.</p>
<p>When <b>Hermite</b> mode is active, the knots in and out tangents (out for starting knot, in for ending knot) are represented by 
green circles with lines leading back to the knot it belongs to. You can move the tangent by clicking then dragging it, but when doing so, the
knots oppisite tangent will negate the movements made upon the selected tangent ( this is to keep consistency amongst spline ). Selecting a knot
and moving it while in this mode will result in both tangents moving with it (unlike <b>bezier</b> mode where controls points stay where they are).</p>
<p>To move the camera, hold down the W,S,A,D keys (only one key can be held at a time). The direction of each key is listed below:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>W = Up</li>
<li>S = Down</li>
<li>A = Left</li>
<li>D = Right</li>
</ul>
<p>To focus the camera on the spline (in case you get lost), press the F button. This will move the camera to the splines starting knot</p>
</div>
<div class="Controls">
<h3 id="_Controls">Controls</h3>
<p>The controls for the editor can be found on the right hand side of the application. These controls can be used to help analyze and create your curve. To interpolate
your curve at real time, you can set the interpolate checkbox to true, which will draw a yellow circle along your curve at the time found in the input box found to the right
of the checkbox. The input box on the right represents the time for the interpolation; this time can be manipulate at any time, but the yellow circle will only be shown if
interpolate is set to true. The value of time will be clamped to stay within 0 and the amount of segments of the spline (segments is the amount of knots subtracted by one).</p>
<p>The <b>Bezier</b> and <b>Hermite</b> buttons switch between the editing modes for the spline. The selected mode will be shaded out and un-selectable.</p>
<p>The cameras position can be controlled manually by the input boxes below the editing mode buttons. The axis the input box represents is highlighted to the left 
of the input box. It is still possible to move the camera while changing these values.</p>
</div>
<div class="Files">
<h3 id="_Files">Files</h3>
<p>The new button (can also be found in file menu bar) will create a new spline editor tab that defaults to a straight line. The name will also default to spline.</p>
<p>The close button will close the <b>selected</b> tab. Make sure to save your work before doing closing!</p>
<p>The save button will open up a dialog box where the <b>selected tabs spline</b> can be saved. The default name of the spline will be set to the name of tab and saved as an XML file.</p>
<p>The open button will open up a dialog box where saved splines can be loaded (assure xml file contains spline).</p>
</div>

<p>The math involved for calculating if a point lies on a line doesn't work with straight lines and sometimes other curves. I was originally going to flatten the curve then check if
the point was between the flattened segment but calculating the results weren't as good as they are now.</p>
